# Matching codebase design standards

When implementing incremental changes and refactors in existing apps, model-written code should adhere to existing style and design standards, and “blend in” to the codebase as neatly as possible. Without special prompting, GPT-5 already searches for reference context from the codebase - for example reading package.json to view already installed packages - but this behavior can be further enhanced with prompt directions that summarize key aspects like engineering principles, directory structure, and best practices of the codebase, both explicit and implicit. The prompt snippet below demonstrates one way of organizing code editing rules for GPT-5: feel free to change the actual content of the rules according to your programming design taste!

<guiding_principles>
- Clarity and Reuse: Every component and page should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components.
- Consistency: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified.
- Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.
- Demo-Oriented: The structure should allow for quick prototyping, showcasing features like streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integrations.
- Visual Quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

<frontend_stack_defaults>
- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Icons: Lucide
- State Management: Zustand
- Directory Structure:

/src
 /app
   /api/<route>/route.ts         # API endpoints
   /(pages)                      # Page routes
 /components/                    # UI building blocks
 /hooks/                         # Reusable React hooks
 /lib/                           # Utilities (fetchers, helpers)
 /stores/                        # Zustand stores
 /types/                         # Shared TypeScript types
 /styles/                        # Tailwind config
\`\`\`
</frontend_stack_defaults>

<ui_ux_best_practices>
- Visual Hierarchy: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings.
- Color Usage: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors. 
- Spacing and Layout: Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm. Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling when handling long content streams.
- State Handling: Use skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` to indicate data fetching. Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`).
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate. Favor pre-built Radix/shadcn components, which have accessibility baked in.
